# mapreducer_python

This is a super simple demo on MapReduce for my Big Data presentation.

## How to use

- Grab your Twitter data using the tool available on their site

- Convert it into a txt file using the first method in mapreduce.py

- Map and Reduce the result (tweets.txt)

- Print the final result and have fun

You can perform calculations or do fun stuff by seeing your most tweeted words, for example.
